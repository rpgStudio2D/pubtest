# pubtest

####Introduction
Pubtest is a backend and mobile platform for the general test question bank in vocational schools in Hunan Province. It uses the ThinkPHP+H5+jQuery+MySQL technology stack. During my teaching period as a programming teacher, I provided students with exercises covering subjects such as moral education, Chinese language, mathematics, English, and computer applications.
